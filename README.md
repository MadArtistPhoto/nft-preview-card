- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- ZonerX (for viewing the supplied images)
- Paint.net (for creating the hover effect of the main image)
- Filezilla (for transferring files to free website host)
- ByetHost (for hosting the files I am working on so I can view them on my phones and ipad)
- GitHub Pages
- GitHub (still very un-intuitive, but I'm learning)

### What I learned

- I used 'onmouseover' and 'onmouseout' for the change in the primary image, as I couldn't get ':hover' to work properly.

- I had issues with changes I made to the .html file. When I uploaded it to the host and then would access it with my default browser (Firefox), Firefox would simply load the previously loaded page from its cache and not the new page from host, making it seem that none of my changer were working. It took a bit of hunting to find out how to change this behavior in Firefox.

- Do not throw out an old cell phone. It should still have wifi capabilities. I use my new phone and an old (smaller screen) phone to check my work once I upload it to my website host.

### Continued development

A while back I added a second monitor to my computer. That has made coding so much more delightful. I gives me the ability to have Visual Studio Code open in full screen on one monitor and the page I am working on open in Live Mode in full screen in the other monitor. I highly recommend this upgrade if space, finances, and computer all allow it.

Adding the older, smaller phone to my arsenal has made me become more aware of using multiple media queries for different size screens. I will be working harder to make things look good on my old small phone, new larger phone, 11" ipad, and computer screen.

I am trying to use the README.md files as a place not only for others to see my thoughts, but also as a type of journal to track my progress.

I am learning more about GitHub Pages. I hope to be able to seamlessly go from VSC to GitHub to GitHub Pages so I can view what I am working on with my phones and ipad in almost real time.
